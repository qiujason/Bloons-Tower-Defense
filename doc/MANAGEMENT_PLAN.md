## Sprint 1
* Overall Goal: Make sure each individual element works at the very least
    * Backend: 
        * API for Towers, Balloons
        * API for Layout
        * AlertHandler
    * Frontend:
        * Find a way to visualize everything in the backend
        * Balloon movement (hopefully popping)?

Franklin: Layout + physics
Jason: Bloons (include different ones) + physics
Annshine: Towers + make sure they can be put in valid positions
Jack: Front-end for layout
Eddie: Buttons stuff: side bar for drag and drop, play, pause, fast-forward

## Sprint 2
Overall Goal: Integrate the components
    * Backend:
        * Physics worked out (balloon moving along track)
        * Shooting mechanics
        * Monkeys to turn
        * Implement economy (popping balloon = get money, each tower costs money)
        * Rules of the game (balloon reaches of track)
    * Frontend:
        * Shooting animations
        * Monkeys to turn
        * Display (lives, money )
        * Click tower to show range
    
Franklin: physics, shooting mechanics
Jason: physics, shooting mechanics
Annshine: implement economy
Jack: front-end animations (shooting, turning monkeys)
Eddie: rules of the game, display, click tower to show range

## Sprint 3
Overall: Enhance the game
    * Backend:
        * Upgrade towers (one-track)
        * Different types of game modes - easy/medium/hard, infinite waves, capped money
        * Save progress
        * Sell towers
        * Level progression
    * Frontend:
        * Descriptions of towers
        * Splashscreen for home page
      
Franklin: Different types of game modes, level progression
Jason: upgrade tower
Annshine: sell tower
Jack: splashscreen, menu in-game
Eddie: front end implementation for upgrading towers, clicking stuff
