Start by showing off the features of your running program:

* run the program from the master branch through a planned series of steps/interactions (including showing how bad data or interactions are handled â€” if any are yet)
NOTE, as each feature is shown, someone on the team should briefly describe how work they did over the past week relates to it

Eddie can talk about multiple tower buttons, status display. Multiple bloon waves/projectiles.

* show any data files that have been created and describe how they are used within your program (focus on the file content rather than the code that uses it)

Annshine can talk about bank files and round bonuses. Franklin can maybe discuss bloons files. Jason can
discuss bloons type files.

* show a variety of JUnit or TestFX tests (including both happy and sad paths) and discuss how comprehensively they cover the feature(s) and why you chose the values used in the tests

Scroll through some tests.

Then present what was learned during this Sprint and the implementation plan for the next Sprint:

* describe how much of the planned features were completed this Sprint and what helped or impeded progress (or if the estimate was just too much)

Most if not all of our individual features were implemented this Sprint, but we weren't quite able to
integrate as much as we wanted.

* describe a specific significant event that occurred this Sprint and what was learned from it

Trying to implement controller, big team paired programming effort.  It was a big refactoring effort
that was much easier working together.

* describe what worked regarding your teamwork and communication, what did not, and what evidence you have that your teamwork has improved

Paired programming helped progress Controller, calling each other to get feedback on design issues and keep
everyone informed.

* what features are planned to be completed for the final version (taking into account what was, or was not, done this Sprint), who will work on each feature, and how confident your team feels going into the final coding weekend

Upgrades, more splash screens to add user-level flexibility, and using data files to make the design more flexible.
