## Design Goals
 
 ### What are your goals for the project?
     * Make a platform that runs a few games and can easily have new games added to it.
     * Create an actually playable game that follows good design practices.
     * Employ everything we learned throughout the class in terms of object oriented programming!
     * Make a game good enough for Cool Math Games!!!  
     * Make a cool project that can run lots of well-designed games that we can show off to friends
 ### What parts of the project do you want to spend more or less effort on?
     * Spend time making sure that our project is extensible for future implementations
     * Spend more time on planning out the inheritance hierarchy and team discussions on design choices
     * Spend more time in making the front end look aesthetic
     * I want to spend a lot of time on creating good abstractions rather than shortsighted ones.
     * Spend time on high level design thoughts and making sure the project can be easily added on to.
 ### What would mark good progress for each Sprint/week?
     * Developing new features that build upon our previous design
     * Having a base part of a new game implemented, or adding new features to an aspect of the project,        like new GUI elements.
     * Not having to cram late nights before each deadline
     * Hitting our goals
     * Making sure that we are on top of the features and keeping track of what went well and what needs more work on
